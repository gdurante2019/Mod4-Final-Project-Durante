    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The Module 4 Project in the Flatiron School Data Science Version 2 Curriculum is meant to provide students with experience in working with time series data--in this case, monthly housing values from 04/01/1996 to 03/01/2018 for over 14,000 ZIP Codes in the U.S.  Skill sets required to complete this project include dataframe manipulation, data cleaning, data visualization, and time series analysis, and other areas (e.g., using github, Jupyter notebooks for data science projects, and writing and posting a blog).  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Project topic\n",
    "\n",
    "The project asks the student to identify the 5 \"best\" ZIP codes for investment, as defined by the student, and develop support for these recommendations to a hypothetical client (e.g., a real estate investment trust).  The student must develop a methodology for evaluating ZIP codes as potential investment targets and support these findings through a technical Jupyter notebook, a non-technical PowerPoint presentation, and a blog post.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## My focus:  Sacramento metro area\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the investment group is located in the Sacramento region, and because the Sacramento area has experience steady group over the last few decades (fueled in part by skyrocketing costs in the SF Bay Area, prompting some businesses to launch or relocate to the Sacramento region), I focused most of my efforts on the Sacramento metro area.  Because I have lived here for a number of years, I have some knowledge of the region, which has provided some helpful insights informing the analysis."

    "As may be obvious in the case of the plot of ZIP codes in the City of Sacramento above, the value of plotting all ZIP codes in one figure may not be very useful if there are a large number of ZIP codes in that area.  In the case of Sacramento, I used the same iterative function to plot all of the ZIP codes within the City of Sacramento on different plots.

    "#### Selecting ARIMA modeling approach for housing time series data\n",
    "\n",
    "Analyzing time series data requires a number of decisions around data manipulation and modeling tool selection.  In the case of this housing data, the effects of seasonality on home values turned out to be negligible, so I did not include a seasonality parameter in the modeling.  However, the optimization of other parameters--autoregression ('AR'), differencing/integrating ('I'), and analyzing moving averages ('MA')--was important for creating a more accurate model with better predictive ability (the ARIMA model).  \n",

    "Combining the three elements of ARIMA modeling requies selecting values for each of three parameters: 1) the number of lag periods (p); 2) the steps between periods for differencing (d); and 3) the number of periods to include for moving average calculations (q).  \n",
    "* While certain visualization methods, such as ACF and PACF, can provide some clues for selecting good values for the parameters, there is still some guesswork and additional analyses involved in an effort to fine-tune parameters (Reference:  https://online.stat.psu.edu/stat510/lesson/3/3.1).  \n",
    "* Another way to identify the best parameters is to take a brute-force computational approach:  for each parameter, select the number of lags or periods, then run the model for each combination and select the model with the lowest MSE.  \n",
    "  * As the number of ZIP codes I analyzed ended up being rather large (~20), this is the approach I utilized.  This ensures consistency of analysis across ZIP codes--as opposed to selecting multiple parameter candidates based on a combination of plots and trial-and-error analyses.\n",
    "  * While it takes quite some time to run the optimization function, once the optimal p,d,q parameters have been provided, the rest of the modeling and forecasting process is very fast.  "
